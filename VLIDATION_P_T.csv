At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two.

For example, one study found that people who believed they were receiving an electric shock were more likely to feel pain than those who did not believe they were receiving a shock.

However, it is important to note that the nocebo effect is not the same as the placebo effect. The placebo effect is when we believe we are receiving a treatment (even if it is just a sugar pill) and this belief leads to a positive outcome (such as feeling less pain).

I haven’t been feeling myself for a while…I don’t know what to do,"You might want to consult with a mental health professional to see if you are experiencing any clinical symptoms of depression or anxiety.

Additionally, there are many self-care activities that can help improve your mood, such as exercise, journaling, or spending time outdoors."
I gave the worst thesis proposal presentation,"It is not uncommon for students to have difficulties when presenting their thesis proposal. There are a number of things that can contribute to a poor presentation, such as nerves, inexperience, or simply not being well-prepared. If you find yourself in this situation, there are a few things you can do to try and salvage the situation.

First, try to stay calm and focused. It can be easy to get flustered and lose your train of thought when things are not going well, but try to stay as calm as possible. Take a few deep breaths and try to relax.

Second, try to focus on the positive aspects of your presentation. Even if it is not going as well as you had hoped,"
"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.","It sounds like you are feeling a lot of guilt and shame about your past behavior. It's understandable that you would feel this way, especially if your boyfriend has forgiven you. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and that what's important is how you learn from them and move forward. It sounds like you are doing that, and so is your boyfriend. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the progress you have made, rather than dwelling on the negative. If you find it difficult to forgive yourself, talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings."
"All my friends have either hooked up or had a girlfriend but me. I try to be happy for them, but I get really upset every time they hook up.","I'm sorry to hear that you feel left out when your friends hook up. It can be tough to see other people find happiness in relationships when we feel like we're struggling to find that same happiness. However, it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different. Just because your friends have found someone to hook up with or have started dating doesn't mean that you're never going to find that same happiness. There's someone out there for everyone, so don't give up hope. Hang in there and eventually you'll find what you're looking for."
"It's the way my mom said I was worth nothing, stupid, no point of being in school. I'm ""lazy little fat.""",This is an example of how someone's parents can negatively affect their child's self-esteem. The child in this example may start to believe that they are worthless and stupid because that is what their parents have told them. This can lead to the child feeling bad about themselves and may even make them give up on school.
"I don't know what's wrong with me. At times I can be really happy, excited, I'll talk fast, and I want to do things. But lately I've been staying up way later and sleeping too much. I don't hang out with friends, I don't really have them. I feel nothing, worthless. I want to do nothing, I have no interest in anything.    All I usually do is stay in my room. I want to be happy, I want to be nice. What's wrong with me?","There could be a number of things causing you to feel this way. It could be a chemical imbalance, depression, anxiety, or a number of other things. If you're concerned, you should speak to a doctor or mental health professional to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
How to deal with intrusive thoughts as a coping mechanism,"There are many ways to deal with intrusive thoughts, but one of the most effective coping mechanisms is to simply acknowledge them and then let them go.

If your ex-boyfriend is harassing and stalking you at work, that is definitely not appropriate behavior and your company should take steps to address the situation."
"I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare I can’t get to the bottom of. I’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship?
   While I’m not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I don’t take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I’ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","There are a few different possibilities as to why you might be experiencing this anxiety around relationships. It could be a combination of factors, including nerves, a fear of bad relationships, and possibly even some unresolved issues from past relationships. If you can, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore these issues further and find some tools to help you manage your anxiety. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself and taking things slowly when it comes to any potential relationships."
I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I also have voices in my head. I have problems sleeping too. I've already been diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I have self-harmed in the last and used to be suicidal. How do I tell them this and ask for therapy?,"There is no single answer to this question, as it will vary depending on your specific situation. However, it is generally recommended that you speak with your primary care physician or mental health professional about your concerns. They will be able to assess your symptoms and provide you with recommendations for treatment."
"My husband and I would've been married for five years come June 2016. Our infant daughter just had her birthday. Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.    It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers. He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? Where do you recommend researching this?","There is no specific ""detachment disorder"" that I am aware of, but it is possible that your husband may be suffering from a form of mental illness that makes it difficult for him to maintain close relationships. It is also possible that he has a problem with alcohol dependence that contributes to his difficulty in maintaining close relationships. I would recommend that you research both of these possibilities further and talk to a mental health professional to get their opinion on what may be going on with your husband."
"My husband always works. He does work from home, but his hours are from morning until night, and he neglects his family. If I have anything I want to do, I have to find a babysitter, but he does what he wants. He rarely comes to bed when I do, and we never have date nights.","This is not an ideal situation. You and your husband should discuss ways to spend more time together. Perhaps he can work fewer hours, or you can find a babysitter for the occasional night out."
I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. How can I start accepting myself and be more confident?,"There are a few things that you can do in order to start accepting yourself and be more confident. First, try to focus on your positive qualities and attributes. Write them down if you need to, and refer to them when you are feeling low about yourself. Secondly, try to engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with people who make you feel good. Finally, try to be mindful of your thoughts and reframe any negative thoughts about yourself into positive ones."
"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","It's okay to feel angry and hurt towards your mom for the mistakes she made.

"Any time things get heated, the past gets brought up. I raise my voice at her to try to get a point across. She asks open-ended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me. She's seven months pregnant. I have drank in the past, but I'm not dependent on alcohol—I only drink at social events.","It sounds like your wife is feeling insecure and is using your past drinking habits as a way to try to control you. This is likely to be a bigger issue for her during pregnancy, when she is feeling more vulnerable. Try to be understanding and patient, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you."

"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","There could be a few reasons why you're not feeling interested in anyone at the moment. It could be that you're still healing from your previous relationship and need some more time to yourself. Alternatively, it could be that you're subconsciously raising your standards after seeing what you're truly capable of in a healthy relationship. Either way, it's important to trust your gut and take things at your own pace. If you're not ready to date again yet, that's perfectly okay. Focus on enjoying your own company and the things that make you happy."
"I have everything in life, but my self-esteem does not exist","This is a difficult question to answer, as self-esteem is a complex and multi-faceted concept. However, a few possible reasons why someone might have everything in life but no self-esteem could include feelings of being undeserving or unworthy, insecurity or self-doubt, or simply not valuing oneself. It is important to remember that everyone has different needs and experiences, so what one person needs to feel good about themselves may not be the same for another. If you are struggling with self-esteem, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore the root causes of your low self-esteem and develop healthy coping mechanisms."
"I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.","It can be difficult to come out to your parents, especially if you are worried about their reaction. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone – there are many other people in the world who identify as LGBTQIA+, and your parents can learn to accept and support you.

One way to approach the conversation is to start by telling your parents that you need to talk to them about something important. You can then explain that you are attracted to people of the same gender, and that you want them to know and accept this part of you. You can also reassure them that you are still the same person they love, and that nothing has changed except your understanding of your own identity.

"I was texting a guy who wasn't my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out. We work together, so he went to work and told everyone I was cheating on him. I moved out of the house. There have been previous problems, and I feel like I'm usually the issue here. In order for us to move on, he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesn't want me to do anymore. I'm wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if I should walk away.","If your boyfriend feels like he needs a contract in order to trust you, then that is not a healthy relationship. Trust should be built on communication and mutual respect, not on a legal document. If you don't feel like you can trust your boyfriend or communicate openly with him, then it may be time to walk away."
"My boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago. I love him, but his dog is wrecking my house. Every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up (including the couch). He's slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere. Even though I come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance. I can't financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house. I've tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well. The dog is the only thing we fight about because I want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesn't want to see him go. It’s not the dog fault though; I understand that. The dog is only a year old, and he isn't a bad dog. He's just too big of a dog for where he is; he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog. I don't hate the dog, but I just can't afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.","It sounds like you have tried to talk to your boyfriend about the situation, but it isn't working out. Perhaps you could try to find a compromise - for example, see if there is a way to crate the dog when you are not home so that he can't destroy the house. If that isn't possible, or if your boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, then you may have to consider breaking up with him. It isn't fair to you to have to put up with this situation, and it doesn't sound like your boyfriend is willing to do anything to change it."

"I got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years. We both fell in love and have been together for eight months. He left the house and filed for divorce. He decided to tell her about our relationship, and she is willing to forgive and work on things. This shook him. They have two kids together. He decided to put the divorce on hold. He left town for a month to get clarity on the situation and see a therapist.","This is a difficult situation. If your friend is married and has children, then he has a responsibility to them that he needs to consider. If he is unsure about the divorce, then it may be best to put it on hold for now and explore other options. If his wife is willing to forgive and work on things, then that is a positive sign. However, your friend needs to make sure that he is doing what is best for him and his family."

"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","It sounds like you have every right to be upset with your husband for lying to you about drinking again. If he has promised to limit his alcohol consumption and is not following through on that, it is understandable that you would feel betrayed. It is important to communicate your feelings to him and to set clear boundaries about what you are and are not willing to tolerate in your relationship. If he is unwilling to be honest with you and to work on his drinking problem, it may be necessary to consider separation or divorce."
